# 0.7 (2022-10-23)

**Bug Fixes:**
- Spellcasting guide has incorrect information on obtaining new spells, and creating Magic Table
- Flesh spells show incorrect Mana cost
- Some mobs don't react properly to getting hit by spell

**BIG CHANGES:**
- Class system abandoned in favour of more flexible "choose-your-own-playstyle" game.
- The "Essences" have been renamed to "Souls".
- New Magic Table, crafted by throwing a piece of red wool on top of a bookshelf.
- Spells are now cast through equipped Runes on Staffs.
- Runes can be crafted at any time, you'll just need to know the recipe for it. Recipes can be seen in Research Books (see Items for more info)
- Spells will have a required staff it needs to be equipped on, in order to cast (listed in the Lore). (Ex: Torch will need a Beginner, but Blizzard will need a Master Staff)
- New Soul items: Soul, Soul Energy, and Soul Core.

**ITEMS:**
Research Books:
- Found as loot in dungeons, or as a rare drop from mobs.
- Will show the recipe for the rune it is for. Best to hold onto them, just in case!
- Aren't required to craft spells.

Soul:
- Obtained by throwing a Sculk, Soul Sand, or Soul Soil block on top of a Soul Campfire.
- After an in-game day, the Soul will be able to be collected.

Soul Energy:
- Obtained by placing a Nether Star on top of a Soul Campfire.

Soul Core:
- Obtained by defeating the Warden.

**Wand/Staff Changes:**
- Wands are now called Staffs.
- The staff is now upgraded through five tiers using Souls - Beginner (Default), Novice (10 Souls), Intermediate (30 Souls), Expert (60 Souls), and Master (1 Soul Energy)
- Upgrading a staff adds an additional Rune slot to it.
- (Coming soon) - Staffs will visually change appearance when they are upgraded to reflect their power.
- Staffs now have Rune slots, from 1 to 5. Runes are used to cast spells.
- Shift + right-click will still cycle through equipped spells.

**Runes:**
- Runes are crafted at the Magic Table using Lapis, Elemental Souls, and other items.
- Runes can be changed anytime at a Rune Table.

**Soul Campfires:**
- Throwing a single Sculk or Soul Sand/Soil block will start extracting the souls in it.
- After one in-game day, the block will be consumed, and a Soul will drop.
