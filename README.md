# Classes
A datapack for an RPG classes inspired system in Minecraft.

## !! Important Note !!
This datapack is under heavy construction, and only the framework is being developed at this time.

It is only being developed under Minecraft 1.19+. **Backporting will NOT happen, ever**. A lot of the functions used are only available in current versions, and I'll continue to add more features as Mojang adds even more. When that happens, *legacy versions will be unsupported*.

**The current build is *playable*, but it's being *actively* worked on, so expect bugs.

## Updated Direction
After a *lot* of iteration, I found that a lot of players were wanting more flexibility than being locked into a particular class.

To overcome this, v0.7 and onwards has fundamentally changed the datapack. Abilities are now granted through equipable Runes. Currently, these only exist for the Staff, but will be updated to include Armor for more passive abilities, and Weapon-specific Runes.

This will allow for a lot of flexibility. Want to be a Mage but able to heal nearby animals like the Ranger? Or maybe you want to wear full netherite armor, but also cast some spells? All of this, and more, will be possible.

The pack is very much a work-in-progress, and balancing will come down the road later as I get more feedback. Please, give solid feedback on what you like/don't like. With all of the coding, I rarely have time to play it myself. So, I'm only going off of the context of how I *think* it would work.

## Support/Suggestions
Please file bug reports in the Issues page here on Github, or let me know in the Discord: discord.gg/dSbgxYRBTq

## Old Minecraft Version Support
I'll say it again here and elaborate further.

Mojang constantly updates the game, and makes additional features that I may use. Which means the datapack won't work in older versions of Minecraft. I also don't have the time (or patience) to support 10 different versions of the game. So, the datapack will *always* be coded for the latest. I will *only* support the latest version of the datapack. If you experience bugs outside of the latest version, you will be asked to update, or to not use it at all.


## But I have to use X Minecraft version because I use Y mod!
**TL;DR:** I really don't give a shit. Use a different mod.

**Long Version:** I know a lot of mods see an update cycle of once a decade, but I'm not beholden to them. And I'm not going to stress myself out by supporting 10 versions of Minecraft, because some mod author doesn't want to update their mod to the latest. This datapack will *always* target the latest version of Minecraft, and I will only care about if something doesn't work on the latest version of Minecraft.

If you use a mod that hasn't updated, don't bug other mod creators to provide a backported version (often impossible). Ask the mod author of the outdated mod to update. It's time.

And if they don't/can't, then find a different mod.
